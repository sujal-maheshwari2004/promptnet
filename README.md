# PromptNet

PromptNet is a self-hostable, language-agnostic server for versioning and serving
prompts to AI agents over a network — the way a Git server serves repositories.
You run the server, your prompts live in your infrastructure, and your agents
fetch them by URI over gRPC.

It is a single Go binary that stores, validates, serves, versions, caches, and
distributes prompts, plus a Python and a JavaScript client, and `promptctl`, a
git-backed authoring CLI with a semantic diff.

Two pieces are new here, and the rest of the system exists to serve them:

- **The Semantic Propagation Diff** — a diff that measures *how far an edit's
  meaning shift ripples* through a prompt, separating a safe local tweak from a
  structural rewrite. A text diff cannot express this. See
  [Semantic Propagation Diff](#semantic-propagation-diff).
- **Change distribution to agents** — prompts are not static files an agent reads
  once; they are live, versioned resources, and the server pushes a notification
  to every subscribed agent the instant one changes. See
  [Pub/sub distribution](#pubsub-distribution).

Everything else — gRPC transport, the commit DAG, caching, auth — is in service
of getting those two capabilities to production safely.

## Overview

A prompt is a small versioned record:

| Field | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uri` | `promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome` | unique address of the prompt |
| `template` | `Hi {name}, welcome to {org}!` | the text, with `{slot}` placeholders |
| `slots` | `["name", "org"]` | the variables the template expects |
| `version_hash` | `80ec4e4d…` | sha256 of template + slots; changes when content changes |

Agents fetch the template and fill in the slots themselves. Every prompt is
validated both when written and when served, so a malformed prompt can never
reach an agent.

The server provides:

- **Versioning** — each change is a commit in a per-prompt history DAG, with
  branches, merges, and a content hash. See
  [Versioning](#versioning-commits-branches-and-merges).
- **Serving** — agents call `GetPrompt(uri)` over gRPC and receive the template,
  slots, and version hash.
- **Semantic diff** — a propagation diff that measures how far an edit's meaning
  shift ripples through a prompt, distinguishing a local tweak from a structural
  rewrite. See [Semantic Propagation Diff](#semantic-propagation-diff).
- **Caching** — opt-in client- and server-side caches keyed by URI, with an
  optional shared Redis backend.
- **Distribution** — an embedded NATS server notifies subscribers when a prompt
  changes.
- **Operations** — token auth with org scoping and expiry, TLS/mTLS, Prometheus
  metrics, audit logs, per-org rate limiting, backup/restore, and schema
  migrations.

## Installation

Requirements:

- **Go** 1.25+ — <https://go.dev/dl/>
- **buf** — <https://buf.build/docs/installation> — the only proto tool needed;
  it uses remote plugins, so no `protoc` or plugin installs.
- **Python** 3.13 + `pip install grpcio "protobuf>=7.35"` — only for the Python
  client (buf's remote plugin emits recent protobuf gencode).

Build:

```sh
make build        # buf generate + go build -> ./promptnet(.exe)
make test         # go test ./...
```

Or by hand:

```sh
buf generate                            # proto -> Go + Python stubs
go build -o promptnet ./cmd/promptnet   # build the binary
go test ./...                           # run tests
```

Run with Docker instead:

```sh
docker compose up        # builds and serves on :8443 (gRPC), :2112 (metrics), :4222 (NATS)
```

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. write a template
echo "Hi {name}, welcome to {org}!" > welcome.txt

# 2. store it locally (declares the two slots; validation runs here)
./promptnet put -uri promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome \
  -file welcome.txt -slot name -slot org
# -> stored promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome (80ec4e4d88e6)

# 3. serve it (set a token to require auth; omit PROMPTNET_TOKEN for open access)
PROMPTNET_TOKEN=secret ./promptnet serve -addr :8443
```

Fetch it from an agent (Python):

```python
from promptnet import PromptClient

client = PromptClient(host="localhost:8443", token="secret")
prompt = client.get("promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome")
text = prompt.template.format(name="Sujal", org="Acme")
```

Storing a prompt whose template and slots disagree fails and writes nothing:

```sh
./promptnet put -uri promptnet://acme/bad/x -file welcome.txt -slot name
# -> validation failed: template uses undeclared slots: org   (exit 1)
```

## Concepts

- **URI** — every prompt has a unique address: `promptnet://org/repo/name`. It is
  stored and looked up as a plain string. The first path segment is the **org**,
  used for auth scoping.
- **Slot** — a `{name}` placeholder in the template. Declared slots must exactly
  match the placeholders the template uses (see [Validation](#validation)).
- **Version hash** — a sha256 over template and slots. Identical content always
  produces the same hash; it is the cache key and the content identity of a
  version.
- **Commit** — one node in a prompt's history, content-addressed and pointing at
  its parent(s). Carries author, message, and timestamp.
- **Branch / ref** — a named pointer to a commit. `main` is the trunk and the
  served version. Other branches are work in progress until merged.

## Versioning: commits, branches, and merges

Each prompt has its own history DAG. Publishing a change appends a commit; the
`main` branch is the **served HEAD** — what `GetPrompt` returns. Branches let you
develop a change in isolation; merging promotes it to `main`.

```text
main:    A ─────────── M   (M = merge commit, served HEAD)
                ╲      ╱
feature:         B ── C     (published to the branch, invisible to GetPrompt)
```

A commit's identity includes its content **and** its lineage, so reverting to old
content produces a new commit rather than colliding with the original.

Typical flow over the API:

```sh
# publish onto main (default) — moves the served HEAD, notifies subscribers
promptnet publish -uri promptnet://acme/support/agent -file v1.txt -slot name

# (via a gRPC client) branch, publish onto the branch, then merge back:
#   CreateBranch  uri, name="feature", from="main"
#   PublishPrompt uri, template=…, branch="feature"   # served HEAD unchanged
#   MergeBranch   uri, into="main", from="feature"     # served HEAD now = feature content
#   History       uri, branch="main"                   # the commit log, newest first
#   DiffCommits   uri, from_hash, to_hash              # semantic diff of any two commits
```

### Pinning & rollback

Agents do not have to track HEAD. `GetPrompt(uri, ref)` fetches a specific branch
tip or commit, so an agent can **pin** a version and upgrade deliberately; the
response carries the `commit_hash` to pin to. `SetBranch(uri, branch, commit)`
points a branch at any existing commit — pointing `main` at an older commit is an
instant, atomic **rollback** that immediately changes what every HEAD reader gets
(cache invalidated, subscribers notified).

```sh
# (via a gRPC client)
#   GetPrompt  uri, ref="v3"            # or a commit hash, or a branch name
#   SetBranch  uri, branch="main", commit_hash=<old>   # roll the served version back
```

Behavior notes:

- **Publishing to a non-`main` branch** records a commit but does not change the
  served HEAD, invalidate the cache, or notify subscribers — branch work is
  invisible until merged.
- **Merging** records a two-parent merge commit on the target branch. Merge
  content is taken from the source branch ("take theirs"); the merge then shows
  up as a diff against the first parent. Three-way content auto-merge is not yet
  implemented.
- **History** walks the first-parent chain (the mainline), newest first.

## gRPC API

Defined in
[proto/promptnet/v1/prompt.proto](proto/promptnet/v1/prompt.proto):

```proto
service PromptService {
  rpc GetPrompt(GetPromptRequest)       returns (GetPromptResponse);
  rpc DiffPrompt(DiffPromptRequest)     returns (DiffPromptResponse);   // diff stored vs. an edit
  rpc PublishPrompt(PublishPromptRequest) returns (PublishPromptResponse);
  rpc History(HistoryRequest)           returns (HistoryResponse);      // commit log of a branch
  rpc CreateBranch(CreateBranchRequest) returns (CreateBranchResponse);
  rpc MergeBranch(MergeBranchRequest)   returns (MergeBranchResponse);
  rpc DiffCommits(DiffCommitsRequest)   returns (DiffPromptResponse);   // diff any two commits
  rpc SetBranch(SetBranchRequest)       returns (SetBranchResponse);    // rollback / pin a branch
}
```

`GetPromptRequest` takes an optional `ref` (a branch name or commit hash) to fetch
a pinned version instead of the served HEAD; the response then includes the
`commit_hash` served. `SetBranch` points a branch at an existing commit — moving
`main` is an instant rollback.

Key messages:

```proto
message PublishPromptRequest {
  string uri = 1;
  string template = 2;
  repeated string slots = 3;
  string message = 4;   // optional commit message
  string branch  = 5;   // target branch; empty = "main"
}

message Commit {
  string hash = 1;
  string version_hash = 2;
  string parent = 3;
  string parent2 = 4;   // set only on merge commits
  string author = 5;
  string message = 6;
  string created_at = 7;  // RFC3339
}

message HistoryRequest      { string uri = 1; string branch = 2; }       // branch empty = "main"
message CreateBranchRequest { string uri = 1; string name = 2; string from = 3; }
message MergeBranchRequest  { string uri = 1; string into = 2; string from = 3; string message = 4; }
message DiffCommitsRequest  { string uri = 1; string from_hash = 2; string to_hash = 3; }
```

Errors are standard gRPC status codes:

| Code | When |
| --- | --- |
| `NotFound` | no prompt, branch, or commit at the given identifier |
| `InvalidArgument` | the prompt failed validation, or a required field is empty |
| `Unauthenticated` | missing, wrong, or expired token |
| `PermissionDenied` | the token's org scope does not match the URI's org |
| `DataLoss` | a stored prompt failed serve-time validation |
| `Internal` | storage or lookup error |

## `promptnet` CLI

```text
promptnet serve      run the gRPC server
promptnet put        validate and store a prompt in a local database
promptnet diff       semantic propagation diff (stored vs. an edited file) via a server
promptnet publish    publish a new version through a server and notify subscribers
promptnet watch      subscribe to a prompt's change events (NATS)
promptnet backup     dump every prompt as JSON lines
promptnet restore    load prompts from a JSON-lines dump
promptnet migrate    apply pending schema migrations and print the version
promptnet gen-token  print a fresh random bearer token
```

Selected flags:

- **`serve`** — `-addr`, `-db`, `-tls-cert`, `-tls-key`, `-client-ca` (mTLS),
  `-tokens-file`, `-cache-ttl`, `-redis-url`, `-embed-url`, `-embed-model`,
  `-nats-addr`, `-metrics-addr`, `-rate-limit`, `-rate-burst`.
- **`put`** — `-uri`, `-file` (`-` for stdin), `-slot` (repeatable), `-db`,
  `-force`, `-embed-url`, `-embed-model`.
- **`diff` / `publish`** — `-addr`, `-uri`, `-file`, `-slot`, `-tls`, `-ca-cert`,
  `-cert`, `-key`.

`put` runs a pre-commit semantic check: when it overwrites an existing prompt it
diffs the stored version against your edit, prints the report, and **refuses a
structural change** unless you pass `-force`.

See [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference) for environment variables.

## Client libraries

### Python

```python
from promptnet import PromptClient

client = PromptClient(host="localhost:8443", token="secret")
prompt = client.get("promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome")

print(prompt.template)      # Hi {name}, welcome to {org}!
print(list(prompt.slots))   # ['name', 'org']
print(prompt.version_hash)  # 80ec4e4d…
```

`PromptClient(host, token=None, tls=False, ca_cert=None, cache_ttl=0, nats_url=None)`:

- `host` — `address:port` of the server.
- `token` — sent as `authorization: Bearer <token>`; omit if the server has no
  token configured.
- `tls` / `ca_cert` — use TLS, optionally pinning a CA certificate.
- `cache_ttl` — client-side (L1) cache TTL in seconds.
- `nats_url` — endpoint for `subscribe()`.

Add the adapter to your path or pip-install it:
`sys.path.insert(0, "adapters/python")`.

### JavaScript (Node)

The Node adapter mirrors the Python one
([adapters/js/client.js](adapters/js/client.js)). It loads the `.proto` at
runtime, so there is no codegen:

```js
const { PromptClient } = require("./adapters/js/client");
const client = new PromptClient({ host: "localhost:8443", token: "secret" });
const prompt = await client.get("promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome");
console.log(prompt.template, prompt.version_hash);
```

`npm i @grpc/grpc-js @grpc/proto-loader` (and `nats` for `subscribe()`).

> The bundled clients cover `get`, `diff`, and `subscribe`. The branch, merge,
> and history RPCs are reachable through the generated stubs (`gen/`,
> `adapters/python/promptnet/v1/`) or any gRPC client using the `.proto`.

## Validation

A prompt is valid when
([internal/validate/validate.go](internal/validate/validate.go)):

1. The URI is non-empty.
2. The template is non-empty.
3. No slot name is empty.
4. Every `{placeholder}` in the template is a declared slot (no **undeclared** slots).
5. Every declared slot appears in the template (no **unused** slots).

Placeholders match `{word}` (letters, digits, underscore). The same function
gates both writes (`put`, `publish`) and reads (`GetPrompt`), so the rules cannot
drift between them.

## Authentication & TLS

**Auth.** Set `PROMPTNET_TOKEN` to require a bearer token; every request must then
send `authorization: Bearer <token>` (checked in constant time). With no tokens
configured the server runs open, for local development.

For multiple keys and org scoping, pass `-tokens-file tokens.txt` with
`token [org] [expiry]` lines:

```text
# tokens.txt
s3cr3t-admin                       # admin: every org, never expires
acme-key      acme                 # scoped: only promptnet://acme/…
rotating-key  acme  2026-12-31     # scoped + expires (date or RFC3339)
```

A bare token is **admin** (all orgs); a token with an org is scoped to
`promptnet://org/…` and gets `PermissionDenied` for other orgs. `PROMPTNET_TOKEN`
is always an admin key. A past expiry is rejected with `Unauthenticated`. Rotate
by overlapping tokens: issue the new key, give the old one a near-future expiry,
drop it once it lapses. `promptnet gen-token` mints a random token.

> Authorization is org-prefix scoping only; per-prompt or read-vs-write rules are
> not modeled.

**TLS.** Pass `-tls-cert` and `-tls-key` to terminate TLS; on the client set
`tls=True` (and optionally `ca_cert`). Without these the server listens in
plaintext.

**mTLS.** Add `-client-ca ca.pem` to also verify the client's certificate
(`RequireAndVerifyClientCert`); connections without a cert signed by that CA are
refused at the TLS layer, before auth. Requires `-tls-cert`/`-tls-key`.

```sh
promptnet serve -tls-cert server.pem -tls-key server.key -client-ca ca.pem
promptnet diff  -uri promptnet://acme/x -file e.txt -tls \
  -ca-cert ca.pem -cert client.pem -key client.key
```

## Storage

[internal/store/store.go](internal/store/store.go) runs on **SQLite** (pure-Go
`modernc.org/sqlite`, no cgo, single binary — the self-hosted default) or
**PostgreSQL** for multi-node deployments. The backend is chosen from `-db`: a
file path uses SQLite; a `postgres://…` DSN uses Postgres (via `pgx`). The schema
and queries are portable across both; only the driver and placeholder style
differ.

```sh
promptnet serve -db promptnet.db                            # sqlite (default)
promptnet serve -db postgres://user:pass@host:5432/prompts  # postgres
```

Schema:

```sql
-- prompts: the materialized tip of each prompt's "main" branch (the served HEAD)
CREATE TABLE prompts (
  uri          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  template     TEXT NOT NULL,
  slots        TEXT NOT NULL,    -- JSON array
  version_hash TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- commits: the history DAG; parent2 is set only on merge commits
CREATE TABLE commits (
  hash         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  uri          TEXT NOT NULL,
  template     TEXT NOT NULL,
  slots        TEXT NOT NULL,
  version_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent       TEXT,
  parent2      TEXT,
  author       TEXT NOT NULL,
  message      TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at   TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- refs: a branch name -> its tip commit
CREATE TABLE refs (
  uri         TEXT NOT NULL,
  branch      TEXT NOT NULL,
  commit_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (uri, branch)
);
```

A commit on `main` updates `commits`, `refs`, and `prompts` in one transaction,
so the served HEAD always reflects the latest committed content. `version_hash`
is `sha256(template + "\0" + slots)`, recomputed on every write.

### Migrations

The schema is an ordered list of migration steps (`migrations` in
[internal/store/store.go](internal/store/store.go)), each applied once. Every
`Open` runs the pending steps in a transaction and records progress in
`schema_version`, so startup is idempotent and a failed step rolls back cleanly.
To evolve the schema, **append** a step — never edit or reorder an existing one.
`promptnet migrate -db …` applies pending steps and prints the version; run it as
a deploy step against Postgres.

### Backup & restore

`backup` dumps every prompt as JSON lines; `restore` upserts them back. The
format is portable, so it doubles as a SQLite↔Postgres migration path, and the
upsert makes restore safe to re-run.

```sh
promptnet backup  -db promptnet.db -out snapshot.jsonl
promptnet restore -db postgres://user:pass@host/prompts -in snapshot.jsonl
```

> Backup/restore covers the served HEAD (the `prompts` table), not the full
> commit history.

## Caching

Two opt-in layers, both keyed by URI with TTL-bounded freshness. Only
**validated** prompts are cached, so a malformed prompt is never served from
cache.

- **Server-side (L2)** — an in-process cache in front of the store. On by
  default; tune with `serve -cache-ttl 30s` (`0` disables).
- **Client-side (L1)** — an in-process cache in the client. Off by default;
  enable with `PromptClient(..., cache_ttl=30)`.

```python
client = PromptClient(host="localhost:8443", token="secret", cache_ttl=30)
client.get("promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome")  # first call hits the server
client.get("promptnet://acme/onboarding/welcome")  # served from L1 for 30s
```

For multi-node deployments, point L2 at **Redis** so instances share one cache:

```sh
promptnet serve -redis-url redis://localhost:6379/0   # or PROMPTNET_REDIS_URL
```

Both backends implement the same `Cache` interface
([internal/server/cache.go](internal/server/cache.go),
[internal/server/redis_cache.go](internal/server/redis_cache.go)); responses are
stored as marshaled protobuf with the TTL as key expiry. Every cache op is
best-effort — a Redis hiccup degrades to a cache miss, never a serving error.

## Semantic Propagation Diff

A text diff tells you *that* a line changed. This tells you *how far the meaning
shift ripples* through the surrounding prompt — the difference between a safe
local tweak and a structural change that quietly rewires how nearby instructions
relate.

For each changed hunk it measures three signals
([internal/semdiff/semdiff.go](internal/semdiff/semdiff.go)):

1. **Signal 1** — the changed region (a line-level LCS diff hunk).
2. **Signal 2** — semantic delta at the point of change: `1 - cosine(old, new)`.
3. **Signal 3** — propagation profile: grow the window outward (±2, ±4, ±6 …), up
   and down independently, recomputing the delta until the curve flattens
   (propagation stopped) or hits the file boundary.

High Signal 2 + flat Signal 3 → **localized tweak**. Signal 3 still high at the
boundary → **structural** (the dangerous one).

The diff runs **server-side**, against the **stored** prompt, using the embedding
model the **operator configured at startup** — so analysis is consistent for
everyone and prompts never leave your infrastructure. With no URL configured the
server falls back to an offline, zero-dependency *lexical* embedder (hashed
bag-of-words) that scores overlap, not meaning. Point `-embed-url` at any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, text-embeddings-inference, llama.cpp) for
real semantics:

```sh
promptnet serve -embed-url http://localhost:11434/v1/embeddings -embed-model nomic-embed-text
# (also reads PROMPTNET_EMBED_URL / _MODEL / _KEY)
```

```sh
promptnet diff -uri promptnet://acme/support/agent -file edited.txt -addr localhost:8443
# change @ new lines 3-3 (old 3-3): replace
#   Signal 2 (point delta): 0.470
#   Signal 3 up:   ±2=0.095 (boundary)
#   Signal 3 down: ±2=0.153 ±4=0.153 (flat)
#   => localized tweak
```

`DiffPrompt` diffs a stored prompt against an edit; `DiffCommits` diffs any two
commits in history. The same engine powers `promptctl diff` for local authoring.

## Authoring with `promptctl`

`promptctl` is the local authoring CLI. Prompts live as `*.prompt` files in a git
repo; versioning, history, and lineage are plain git, embedded via go-git (no
external git binary). promptctl adds validation, the semantic propagation diff,
and environment promotion. A prompt's URI is its path —
`acme/support/agent.prompt` → `promptnet://acme/support/agent`; slots are read
from the template's `{placeholders}`.

```sh
promptctl commit -m "msg"                     # validate every *.prompt, then commit changes
promptctl diff [ref]                           # semantic diff vs ref (default HEAD)
promptctl log acme/support/agent.prompt        # version lineage of one prompt
promptctl promote acme/x.prompt dev prod       # bring a prompt from branch dev onto prod
promptctl push [-server host:port]             # validate, git push, then publish to the server
promptctl pull                                 # sync with origin
promptctl publish -server host:port [paths…]   # publish to the server + notify subscribers
```

- **commit / push** validate first — a malformed prompt blocks the whole commit.
- **diff** compares each changed `*.prompt` between a ref and the working tree
  using the `PROMPTNET_EMBED_*` model (offline lexical by default).
- **promote** models dev → staging → prod as branches: it copies a validated
  prompt from one branch onto another and commits it.
- **push / pull** use go-git and do not read git's credential helper — set
  `PROMPTNET_GIT_TOKEN` for HTTPS remotes; SSH uses your ssh-agent.

`promptctl push -server …` git-pushes *and* publishes each prompt, so subscribers
are notified in the same step. Publishing is idempotent (`PublishPrompt` is a
no-op when the version hash is unchanged), so only changed prompts fire a
notification. Git stays the source of truth; the server is the live serving copy.

## Pub/sub distribution

The server embeds a **NATS** server in-process (still one binary). The
write-through `PublishPrompt` RPC stores a new version *and* notifies subscribers.

```sh
# server: embedded NATS is on by default (-nats-addr "" disables it)
promptnet serve -nats-addr 127.0.0.1:4222

# publish a new version -> stored, cache invalidated, subscribers notified
promptnet publish -uri promptnet://acme/support/agent -file v2.txt -slot name
# published promptnet://acme/support/agent (1e8284f35650) — subscribers notified
```

Each prompt maps to a NATS subject — `promptnet://acme/support/agent` →
`promptnet.acme.support.agent`. An agent subscribes in one line (the push side);
`cache_ttl` is the pull side.

**Notifications carry the diff verdict.** Each event includes the
[Semantic Propagation Diff](#semantic-propagation-diff) classification of the
change (`structural | localized tweak | minor edit | new`), so an agent can
auto-hot-reload a localized tweak but **hold a structural change for review** —
the server already computed the diff on publish.

```python
client = PromptClient(host="…:8443", cache_ttl=30, nats_url="nats://…:4222")

def on_change(version, classification):
    if classification == "structural":
        alert_a_human(version)          # reshapes meaning — gate it
    else:
        reload(version)                 # safe to pick up automatically

client.subscribe("promptnet://acme/support/agent", on_change)  # needs `pip install nats-py`
```

The `promptnet watch` CLI prints the verdict too, and exposes it to `-exec` hooks
as `PROMPTNET_CLASS`.

**Consistency model.** This layer is eventually consistent: a push can be missed
(network), so the TTL is the convergence guarantee, not the push. Notify is
best-effort; the version is durably stored regardless, and subscribers converge
on their next poll.

## Observability & rate limiting

Three gRPC interceptors run in front of every RPC
([internal/server/observability.go](internal/server/observability.go)):

- **Metrics** — a Prometheus endpoint at `-metrics-addr` (default `:2112`, empty
  disables) exposing request counts (`promptnet_requests_total` by method + code),
  a latency histogram (`promptnet_request_duration_seconds`), and Go runtime
  metrics. A sample scrape config is in
  [monitoring/prometheus.yml](monitoring/prometheus.yml).
- **Audit log** — one structured (slog JSON) line per RPC on stderr: method, org
  scope, uri, gRPC code, latency.
- **Rate limiting** — a per-org token bucket. Opt-in via `-rate-limit <rps>`
  (`0` disables); `-rate-burst` sets the burst (defaults to the rps). Over-limit
  calls get `ResourceExhausted`.

```sh
promptnet serve -metrics-addr :2112 -rate-limit 50 -rate-burst 100
curl localhost:2112/metrics
```

## Configuration reference

Environment variables:

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROMPTNET_TOKEN` | server, clients | admin bearer token (server); credential (clients) |
| `PROMPTNET_EMBED_URL` | server, `put` | OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint |
| `PROMPTNET_EMBED_MODEL` | server, `put` | embedding model name |
| `PROMPTNET_EMBED_KEY` | server, `put` | API key for the embeddings endpoint |
| `PROMPTNET_REDIS_URL` | server | Redis URL for a shared L2 cache |
| `PROMPTNET_GIT_TOKEN` | `promptctl` | token for HTTPS git remotes |

CLI flags are listed under [`promptnet` CLI](#promptnet-cli); the
[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) shows a full `serve` invocation.

## Regenerating code from the proto

Everything under `gen/` and `adapters/python/promptnet/v1/` is generated. After
editing the `.proto`:

```sh
buf generate
```

[buf.gen.yaml](buf.gen.yaml) configures the output (Go into `gen/`, Python into
`adapters/python/`) using buf's remote plugins, so no `protoc` or plugin installs
are needed. Do not hand-edit generated files.

## Project layout

```text
proto/promptnet/v1/prompt.proto    The service contract. Source of truth.
gen/                               Generated Go code (do not edit).
adapters/python/promptnet/         Python client: client.py + generated v1/ stubs.
adapters/js/client.js              Node client (loads the proto at runtime).

internal/validate/validate.go      Prompt well-formedness — the one definition of "valid".
internal/store/store.go            SQLite/Postgres storage: prompts, commits, refs, migrations.
internal/semdiff/semdiff.go        The semantic propagation diff engine.
internal/server/server.go          gRPC handlers + auth interceptor.
internal/server/observability.go   Metrics, audit-log, rate-limit interceptors.
internal/server/cache.go           In-process and Redis L2 caches.
internal/pubsub/pubsub.go          Embedded NATS publisher + subscriber.

cmd/promptnet/main.go              Server + operational CLI.
cmd/promptctl/main.go              Git-backed authoring CLI.
```

**Serve request flow:** agent → gRPC → auth interceptor → `Server.GetPrompt` →
`store.Get` → serve-time `validate.Prompt` → response.
